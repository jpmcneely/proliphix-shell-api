Proliphix Shell API
===================

This code is an implementation of the Proliphix NT Thermostat API in
shell (specifically BASH).

The code grew from a desire to have a portable, simple implementation
to use with a Proliphix NT20e thermostat.  The idea being that this
could be used from within other BASH scripts, or with PHP, Perl, etc.
as a system or exec.  The implementation is notably lacking in feature
support for devices other than the NT20e.  This is because I do not
have a test device for any other model.  However, the additional
functions are small in number, and could easily be added by others.

The implementation is not meant to be particularly efficient or elegant.
It is only meant to provide the standard API to a Linux environment.

The Proliphix API is, of course, property of Proliphix, Inc.  Any
documents created by Proliphix for instructional or reference purposes
are, no doubt, covered under copyright.  Such notices will appear in the
original documentation.

The implementation in shell is copyright by me, J.P. McNeely.  I have
released the scripts under the GPL 2.0 license, a copy of which is
included in the file named LICENSE.  Anyone who desires to do so may
use this code, but only according to the terms specified in the 
license (which is very permissive, and designed to promote legally 
sharing code).  I leave it to the reader to examine the license
BEFORE sharing the code further.  You will, no doubt, not find it 
at all difficult to comply with the license unless your goal is to
dishonestly claim ownership of my code.

Suggestions for improvement are welcome!
